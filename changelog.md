## 9/14
Started migrating project to a web environment. The plan is to have a functioning web demo that emulates in-game interactions. It'll be much different than the in-game interface. The backend will share the same architecture but the frontend will be converted into buttons and textboxes.


## 8/24
Unity prototype is completed, NPC was able to process data and prompt LLM via wrapper.


## 7/14
Started working on the actual project. Main goal is to achieve basic functions like input processing and LLM prompting. I'll push the text-to-speech goal back since it isn't really logical to try to do that when I don't have an actual "companion" character. For now the feedback will be displayed using a chatbox.
